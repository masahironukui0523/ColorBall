ColorBall is a intersting interaction by using canvas.

I made it when 2 motnhs passed after I started programming.

Enjoy Interaction with lots of balls which can expand and shrink.

## Usage
There are two easy functions.

- click = shot balls
- enter = dlete some balls

All balls respond cursol.
If balls close to cursor, they start expanding and after balls get out of a certain distance from cursor, they start shrinking.


You can control parameter by youself from tab menu bar at the top of left.
